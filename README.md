# power-relays
A command-line tool for controlling relays attached to Rasbperry Pi gpio pins.

Tested using the following compilers in the following operating systems:

| compiler | version | OS |
|----------|---------|----|
| gcc | 4.8.4 | elementary OS Freya, Ubuntu 14.04 |
| gcc-4.8 | 4.8.2 | Rasbpian 7.8 |
| gcc | 4.6.3, using std=c++0x | elementary OS Luna, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS |

Obviously, compiled using the DEBUG flag in all cases, except on Rasbpian.

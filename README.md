# power-relays
A command-line tool for controlling relays attached to Rasbperry Pi gpio pins.

Tested using the following compilers in the following operating systems:

gcc (version 4.8.4) (elementary OS Freya, Ubuntu 14.04)
gcc-4.8 (version 4.8.2) (Rasbpian 7.8)
gcc (version 4.6.3, using std=c++0x) (elementary OS Luna, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)

Obviously, compiled using the DEBUG flag in all cases, except on Rasbpian.
